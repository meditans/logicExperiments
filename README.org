* Logic experiments

This is a proof of concept theorem prover for a restricted sequent calculus done
for the people of =#narrative-ai= in order to showcase a simple architecture in
which the rules of the calculus are decoupled from the rules of proof search.

The design is done in such a way that a user of the library should be able to
specify only the rules of the logic he's interested in, and get a prover to do
experiments in that logic (we were interested in modal logics in general, and
epistemic logic in particular, to model the internal representation of agents).

The code makes heavy uses of lens library, both as a general language and for
the features in =Control.Lens.Plated=. The simple file contains the definitions
of the data types and rules for the restricted sequent calculus, generic logic
for proving in a search tree, example judgements to try and instances to display
the proof tree in LaTeX (via HaTeX and the bussproofs package).

For example, calling =latexProof jud5= in a repl generates a =tex= file that,
when compiled, yields this proof:
